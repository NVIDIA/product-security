A successful exploit of this vulnerability might lead to code execution, escalation of privileges, data tampering, denial of service, and information disclosure. | [CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) | 7.3 | HIGH | [CWE-78](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78.html) | Code execution, escalation of privileges, data tampering, denial of service, information disclosure |
| CVE-2025-33229 | NVIDIA Nsight Visual Studio for Windows contains a vulnerability in Nsight Monitor where an attacker can execute arbitrary code with the same privileges as the NVIDIA Nsight Visual Studio Edition Monitor application. A successful exploit of this vulnerability may lead to escalation of privileges, code execution, data tampering, denial of service, and information disclosure. | [CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) | 7.3 | HIGH | [CWE-427](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/427.html) | Escalation of privileges, code execution, data tampering, denial of service, information disclosure |
| CVE-2025-33230 | NVIDIA Nsight Systems for Linux contains a vulnerability in the .run installer, where an attacker could cause an OS command injection by supplying a malicious string to the installation path. A successful exploit of this vulnerability might lead to escalation of privileges, code execution, data tampering, denial of service, and information disclosure. | [CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) | 7.3 | HIGH | [CWE-78](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78.html) | Escalation of privileges, code execution, data tampering, denial of service, information disclosure |
| CVE-2025-33231 | NVIDIA Nsight Systems for Windows contains a vulnerability in the application’s DLL loading mechanism where an attacker could cause an uncontrolled search path element by exploiting insecure DLL search paths. A successful exploit of this vulnerability might lead to code execution, escalation of privileges, data tampering, denial of service and information disclosure. | [CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) | 6.7 | MEDIUM | [CWE-427](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/427.html) | Code execution, escalation of privileges, data tampering, denial of service, information disclosure |
