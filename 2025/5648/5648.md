### Notes

TensorRT-LLM added a security enhancement for its socket-based Inter-Process Communication (IPC) that involves Python pickle serialization and deserialization processes.HMAC encryption will be set to encryption ON in both release branch and main branch by default.  While this security enhancement is enabled by default, customers have the option to disable it.<br><div>Warning: Disabling this feature will make you vulnerable to the security issue<br></div><div>Follow these steps to disable the security feature:<br></div><div><ul><li>On the main branch, customers can set “use_hmac_encryption = False” under tensorrt_llm/executor/ipc.py, in the class ZeroMqQueue.<br></li><li>In release 0.18, customers can set “use_hmac_encryption = False” under tensorrt_llm/executor.py, in the class ZeroMqQueue.</li></ul></div>
