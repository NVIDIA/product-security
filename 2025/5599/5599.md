| ---------- | ---------------- | ---------- | -------------- | ------------ | -------- | ------------ |
| CVE-2024-0135 | NVIDIA Container Toolkit contains an improper isolation vulnerability where a specially crafted container image could lead to modification of a host binary. A successful exploit of this vulnerability may lead to code execution, denial of service, escalation of privileges, information disclosure, and data tampering. | [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H) | 7.6 | HIGH | [CWE-653](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/653.html) | Code Execution, Escalation of Privileges, Data Tampering, Denial of Service, Information Disclosure |
| CVE-2024-0136 | NVIDIA Container Toolkit contains an improper isolation vulnerability where a specially crafted container image could lead to untrusted code obtaining read and write access to host devices. This vulnerability is present only when the NVIDIA Container Toolkit is configured in a nondefault way. A successful exploit of this vulnerability may lead to code execution, denial of service, escalation of privileges, information disclosure, and data tampering. | [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H) | 7.6 | HIGH | [CWE-653](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/653.html) | Code Execution, Denial of Service, Escalation of Privileges, Data Tampering, Information Disclosure |
| CVE-2024-0137 | NVIDIA Container Toolkit contains an improper isolation vulnerability where a specially crafted container image could lead to untrusted code running in the host’s network namespace. This vulnerability is present only when the NVIDIA Container Toolkit is configured in a nondefault way. A successful exploit of this vulnerability may lead to denial of service and escalation of privileges. | [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L) | 5.5 | MEDIUM | [CWE-653](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/653.html) | Escalation of Privileges, Denial of Service |

The NVIDIA risk assessment is based on an average of risk across a diverse set of installed systems and may not represent the true risk to your local installation. NVIDIA recommends evaluating the risk to your specific configuration.
