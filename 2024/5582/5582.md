### Details

This section provides a summary of potential vulnerabilities that this security update addresses and their impact. Descriptions use [CWE™](https://cwe.mitre.org/), and base scores and vectors use [CVSS v3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document) standards.

| **CVE ID** | **Description** | **Vector** | **Base Score** | **Severity** | **CWE** | **Impacts** |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ---------- | -------------- | ------------ | -------- | ------------ |
| CVE-2024-0132 | NVIDIA Container Toolkit 1.16.1 or earlier contains a Time-of-check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) vulnerability when used with default configuration where a specifically crafted container image may gain access to the host file system. This does not impact use cases where CDI is used. A successful exploit of this vulnerability may lead to code execution, denial of service, escalation of privileges, information disclosure, and data tampering.	 | [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H) | 9 | CRITICAL | [CWE-367](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/367.html) | Code Execution, Denial of Service, Escalation of Privileges, Information Disclosure, Data Tampering |
| CVE-2024-0133 | NVIDIA Container Toolkit 1.16.1 or earlier contains a vulnerability in the default mode of operation allowing a specially crafted container image to create empty files on the host file system. This does not impact use cases where CDI is used. A successful exploit of this vulnerability may lead to data tampering. | [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N) | 4.1 | MEDIUM | [CWE-367](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/367.html) | Data Tampering |

The NVIDIA risk assessment is based on an average of risk across a diverse set of installed systems and may not represent the true risk to your local installation. NVIDIA recommends evaluating the risk to your specific configuration.
