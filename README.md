# NVIDIA Product Security Repository

Starting October 1, 2025, NVIDIA PSIRT will publish an initial set of security bulletins on GitHub in Markdown, CSAF, and CVE formats to meet industry demand for easier integration. Coverage will expand across product lines over time, while all bulletins will continue to be available on the [Product Security website](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/security/), ensuring access from both sources in parallel.


## Purpose
This repository provides:
- Human-Readable Markdown: Each security bulletin is available in Markdown for easy reading directly on GitHub.
- Machine-Readable CSAF: Bulletins are also published in the [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://www.csaf.io/) format for automated parsing and processing.
- Supplementary CVE Files: Each vulnerability includes additional machine-readable files in the [CVE](https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-schema) Record Format with detailed CVE information.

## Repository Structure
- Bulletins are published in folders by their initial publication year.
- Older bulletins (prior to automated publication) will be added gradually.
