| **CVE ID** | **Description** | **Vector** | **Base Score** | **Severity** | **CWE** | **Impacts** |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ---------- | -------------- | ------------ | -------- | ------------ |
| CVE-2022-42291 | NVIDIA GeForce Experience contains a vulnerability in the installer, where a user installing the NVIDIA GeForce Experience software may inadvertently delete data from a linked location, which may lead to data tampering. An attacker does not have explicit control over the exploitation of this vulnerability, which requires the user to explicitly launch the installer from the compromised directory. | [CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:H) | 8.2 | HIGH | [CWE-1386](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1386.html) | Data Tampering |
| CVE-2022-31611 | NVIDIA GeForce Experience contains an uncontrolled search path vulnerability in all its client installers, where an attacker with user level privileges may cause the installer to load an arbitrary DLL when the installer is launched. A successful exploit of this vulnerability could lead to escalation of privileges and code execution. | [CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H) | 6.8 | MEDIUM | [CWE-427](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/427.html) | Code Execution, Denial of Service, Escalation of Privileges, Information Disclosure, Data Tampering |
| CVE-2022-42292 | NVIDIA GeForce Experience contains a vulnerability in the NVContainer component, where a user without administrator privileges can create a symbolic link to a file that requires elevated privileges to write to or modify, which may lead to denial of service, escalation of privilege or limited data tampering. | [CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H) | 5 | MEDIUM | [CWE-59](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/59.html) | Denial of Service, Data Tampering |

The NVIDIA risk assessment is based on an average of risk across a diverse set of installed systems and may not represent the true risk to your local installation. NVIDIA recommends evaluating the risk to your specific configuration.
