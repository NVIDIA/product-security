| **CVE ID** | **Description** | **Vector** | **Base Score** | **Severity** | **CWE** | **Impacts** |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ---------- | -------------- | ------------ | -------- | ------------ |
| CVE-2023-25512 | NVIDIA CUDA toolkit for Linux and Windows contains a vulnerability in cuobjdump, where an attacker may cause an out-of-bounds memory read by running cuobjdump on a malformed input file. A successful exploit of this vulnerability may lead to limited denial of service, code execution, and limited information disclosure. | [CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L) | 5.3 | MEDIUM | [CWE-125](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/125.html) | Code Execution, Denial of Service |
| CVE-2023-25513 | NVIDIA CUDA toolkit for Linux and Windows contains a vulnerability in cuobjdump, where an attacker may cause an out-of-bounds read by tricking a user into running cuobjdump on a malformed input file. A successful exploit of this vulnerability may lead to limited denial of service, code execution, and limited information disclosure. | [CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L) | 5.3 | MEDIUM | [CWE-125](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/125.html) | Code Execution, Denial of Service |
| CVE-2023-25514 | NVIDIA CUDA toolkit for Linux and Windows contains a vulnerability in cuobjdump, where an attacker may cause an out-of-bounds read by tricking a user into running cuobjdump on a malformed input file. A successful exploit of this vulnerability may lead to limited denial of service, code execution, and limited information disclosure. | [CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L) | 5.3 | MEDIUM | [CWE-125](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/125.html) | Code Execution, Denial of Service |
| CVE-2023-25511 | NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit for Linux and Windows contains a vulnerability in cuobjdump, where a division-by-zero error may enable a user to cause a crash, which may lead to a limited denial of service. | [CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L) | 3.3 | LOW | [CWE-369](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/369.html) | Denial of Service |
| CVE-2023-25510 | NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit SDK for Linux and Windows contains a NULL pointer dereference in cuobjdump, where a local user running the tool against a malformed binary may cause a limited denial of service. | [CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L) | 3.3 | LOW | [CWE-476](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/476.html) | Denial of Service |

The NVIDIA risk assessment is based on an average of risk across a diverse set of installed systems and may not represent the true risk to your local installation. NVIDIA recommends evaluating the risk to your specific configuration.
