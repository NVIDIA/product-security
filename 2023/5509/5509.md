### Details

This section provides a summary of potential vulnerabilities that this security update addresses and their impact. Descriptions use [CWEâ„¢](https://cwe.mitre.org/), and base scores and vectors use [CVSS v3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document) standards.

| **CVE ID** | **Description** | **Vector** | **Base Score** | **Severity** | **CWE** | **Impacts** |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ---------- | -------------- | ------------ | -------- | ------------ |
| CVE-2023-31036 | NVIDIA Triton Inference Server for Linux and Windows contains a vulnerability where, when it is launched with the non-default command line option --model-control explicit, an attacker may use the model load API to cause a relative path traversal. A successful exploit of this vulnerability may lead to code execution, denial of service, escalation of privileges, information disclosure, and data tampering. | [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) | 7.5 | HIGH | [CWE-23](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/23.html) | Code Execution, Denial of Service, Escalation of Privileges, Information Disclosure, Data Tampering |

The NVIDIA risk assessment is based on an average of risk across a diverse set of installed systems and may not represent the true risk to your local installation. NVIDIA recommends evaluating the risk to your specific configuration.
