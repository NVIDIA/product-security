### Details

This section provides a summary of potential vulnerabilities that this security update addresses and their impact. Descriptions use [CWE™](https://cwe.mitre.org/), and base scores and vectors use [CVSS v3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document) standards.

| **CVE ID** | **Description** | **Vector** | **Base Score** | **Severity** | **CWE** | **Impacts** |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ---------- | -------------- | ------------ | -------- | ------------ |
| CVE-2021-34401 | NVIDIA Linux kernel distributions contain a vulnerability in nvmap NVGPU_IOCTL_CHANNEL_SET_ERROR_NOTIFIER, where improper access control may lead to code execution, compromised integrity, or denial of service. The scope impact may extend to other components. | [CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H) | 8.8 | HIGH | [CWE-284](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html) | Denial of Service, Escalation of Privileges, Data Tampering |
| CVE-2021-4034 | NVIDIA Jetson sample file system contains a vulnerability related in polkit's pkexec utility which can lead to local privilege escalation, causing impact to data confidentiality, data integrity, and service availability. | [CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) | 7.8 | HIGH | [CWE-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html) | Code Execution, Denial of Service, Escalation of Privileges, Information Disclosure, Data Tampering |
| CVE-2022-21819 | NVIDIA distributions of Jetson Linux contain a vulnerability where an error in the IOMMU configuration may allow an unprivileged attacker with physical access to the board direct read/write access to the entire system address space through the PCI bus. Such an attack could result in denial of service, code execution, escalation of privileges, and impact to data integrity and confidentiality. The scope impact may extend to other components. | [CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H) | 7.6 | HIGH | [CWE-732](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/732.html) | Code Execution, Denial of Service, Escalation of Privileges, Information Disclosure, Data Tampering |
