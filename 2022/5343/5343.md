### Details

This section provides a summary of potential vulnerabilities that this security update addresses and their impact. Descriptions use [CWE™](https://cwe.mitre.org/), and base scores and vectors use [CVSS v3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document) standards.

| **CVE ID** | **Description** | **Vector** | **Base Score** | **Severity** | **CWE** | **Impacts** |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ---------- | -------------- | ------------ | -------- | ------------ |
| CVE-2022-28195 | NVIDIA Jetson Linux Driver Package contains a vulnerability in the Cboot ext4_read_file function, where insufficient validation of untrusted data may allow a highly privileged local attacker to cause a integer overflow, which may lead to code execution, escalation of privileges, limited denial of service, and some impact to confidentiality and integrity. The scope of impact can extend to other components. | [CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L) | 5.7 | MEDIUM | [CWE-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html) | Code Execution, Denial of Service, Escalation of Privileges, Information Disclosure, Data Tampering |
| CVE-2022-28193 | NVIDIA Jetson Linux Driver Package contains a vulnerability in the Cboot module tegrabl_cbo.c, where insufficient validation of untrusted data may allow a local attacker with elevated privileges to cause a memory buffer overflow, which may lead to code execution, loss of integrity, limited denial of service, and some impact to confidentiality. | [CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L) | 5.6 | MEDIUM | [CWE-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html) | Code Execution, Denial of Service, Escalation of Privileges, Information Disclosure, Data Tampering |
| CVE-2022-28194 | NVIDIA Jetson Linux Driver Package contains a vulnerability in the Cboot module tegrabl_cbo.c, where, if TFTP is enabled, a local attacker with elevated privileges can cause a memory buffer overflow, which may lead to code execution, loss of Integrity, limited denial of service, and some impact to confidentiality. | [CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L) | 5.6 | MEDIUM | [CWE-119](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html) | Code Execution, Denial of Service, Escalation of Privileges, Information Disclosure, Data Tampering |
| CVE-2022-28197 | NVIDIA Jetson Linux Driver Package contains a vulnerability in the Cboot ext4_mount function, where Insufficient validation of untrusted data may allow a highly privileged local attacker to cause an integer overflow. This difficult- to-exploit vulnerability may lead to code execution, escalation of privileges, limited denial of service, and some impact to confidentiality and integrity. The scope of impact can extend to other components. | [CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L) | 5 | MEDIUM | [CWE-190](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/190.html) | Code Execution, Denial of Service, Escalation of Privileges, Information Disclosure, Data Tampering |
| CVE-2022-28196 | NVIDIA Jetson Linux Driver Package contains a vulnerability in the Cboot blob_decompress function, where insufficient validation of untrusted data may allow a local attacker  with elevated privileges to cause a memory buffer overflow, which may lead to code execution, limited loss of Integrity, and limited denial of service. The scope of impact can extend to other components. | [CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:L) | 4.6 | MEDIUM | [CWE-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html) | Code Execution, Denial of Service, Escalation of Privileges, Data Tampering |
